    <title>Prime subfield</title>
    <p>
        We begin with the definition of a prime subfield of a field <m>F</m>.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-prime-subfield">
        <statement>
            <p>
                A field is said to be prime if it is isomorphic to <m>\Q</m> or to one of the finite fields <m>\F_p</m>.
            </p>

        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>R</m> be a ring with a subfield. Then <m>R</m> has a unique subfield <m>P</m> which is a prime field. Furthermore, <m>P</m> is contained in every subfield of <m>R</m>, and also in the center of <m>R</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                Let <m>f\colon\Z\to R</m> be a unique ring homomorphism, and let <m>E\subseteq R</m> be a subfield of <m>R</m>. We put <m>K=E\cap Z(R)</m>. Note that <m>f(\Z)\subseteq K</m>. Therefore, <m>\ker f</m> is either <m>0</m> or it is generated by some prime number <m>p</m>. If <m>\ker f=\{0\}</m>, then <m>f</m> is injective and <m>f</m> can be extended to a field isomomorphism of <m>\Q</m> with a subfield <m>P\subseteq K</m>. If <m>\ker f=(p)</m> then, <m>f</m> defines an isomorphism from <m>\F_p</m> to a subfield <m>P'\subseteq K</m>.
