    <statement>
      <p>
        A polynomial in one indeterminate with coefficients in a ring <m>R</m> is defined as a map <m>P\colon\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\to R</m> such that the image of <m>n\in\Z_{\geq 0}</m> under <m>P</m> is denoted by <m>P_n</m> and the set <m>{\mathrm supp}\,P=\{n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}:P_n\neq 0\}</m> is finite.
