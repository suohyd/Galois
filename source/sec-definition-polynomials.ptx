    <statement>
      <p>
        A polynomial in one indeterminate with coefficients in a ring <m>R</m> is defined as a map <m>P\colon\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\to R</m> such that the image of <m>n\in\Z_{\geq 0}</m> under <m>P</m> is denoted by <m>P_n</m> and the set <m>{\mathrm supp}\,P=\{n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}:P_n\neq 0\}</m> is finite.

      <p>
        Given <m>r\in R</m> we define <m>r\colon\Z_{\geq 0}\to R</m> such that <m>0\mapsto r</m> and <m>n\mapsto 0</m> for all <m>n\in\N</m>.

      <p>
        We define <m>X\colon\Z_{\geq 0}\to R</m> such that <m>1\mapsto 1</m> and <m>n\mapsto 0</m> for all <m>n\neq 1</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        For two polynomials <m>P,Q</m> their addition, <m>P+Q</m> is defined as the addition of functions, i.e., <m>(P+Q)_n=P_n+Q_n</m>. Their product is defined as follows:<me>
          (PQ)_n=\sum_{i+j=n}P_i\cdot Q_j
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The set of all polynomials in one indeterminate with coefficients in a ring <m>R</m> is denoted by <m>R[X]</m>. The set <m>R[X]</m> is a ring with unity, where the unity is the polynomial <m>1\colon\Z_{\geq 0}\to R</m> such that <m>0\mapsto 1</m> and <m>n\mapsto 0</m> for all <m>n\neq 0</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Note that every polynomial <m>P</m> can be uniquely written as <m>P=\sum P_i\cdot X^i</m>.
      So, from now onwards write <m>r_0+r_1X+\cdots+r_nX^n</m> for the polynomial that maps <m>i\in\Z_{\geq 0}</m> to <m>r_i</m> for <m>i=0,1,\ldots,n</m> and to <m>0</m> for <m>i \geq n+1</m>.

        Convince yourself that the usual definition given in terms of formal sums of monomials is equivalent to the definition given above.
