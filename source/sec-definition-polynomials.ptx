      <p>
        A polynomial in one variable with coefficients in a ring <m>R</m> is defined as a map <m>P\colon\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\to R</m> such that the image of <m>n\in\Z_{\geq 0}</m> under <m>P</m> is denoted by <m>P_n</m> and the set <m>\{n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}:P_n\neq 0\}</m> is finite.

        Given <m>r\in R</m> we define <m>r\colon\Z_{\geq 0}\to R</m> such that <m>0\mapsto r</m> and <m>n\mapsto 0</m> for all <m>n\in\N</m>.

      <p>
        For two polynomials <m>P,Q</m> their addition, <m>P+Q</m> is defined as the addition of functions, i.e., <m>(P+Q)_n=P_n+Q_n</m>. Their product is defined as follows:<me>
          (PQ)_n=\sum_{i+j=n}P_i\cdot Q_j

        The set of all polynomials in one indeterminate with coefficients in a ring <m>R</m> is denoted by <m>R[X]</m>. The set <m>R[X]</m> is a ring with unity, where the unity is the polynomial <m>1\colon\Z_{\geq 0}\to R</m> such that <m>0\mapsto 1</m> and <m>n\mapsto 0</m> for all <m>n\neq 0</m>.
      </p>

  </definition>
  <remark>
    <p>
        Note that every polynomial <m>P</m> can be uniquely written as <m>P=\sum P_i\cdot X^i</m>.
      So, from now onwards write <m>r_0+r_1X+\cdots+r_nX^n</m> for the polynomial that maps <m>i\in\Z_{\geq 0}</m> to <m>r_i</m> for <m>i=0,1,\ldots,n</m> and to <m>0</m> for <m>i \geq n+1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, for a nonzero polynomial <m>P</m> the largest integer <m>n</m> for which the coefficient of <m>X^n</m> is not zero is called the <em>leading coefficient</em> of <m>P</m> and <m>n</m> is called the <em>degree</em> of <m>P</m>. A polynomial <m>P</m> is called a <em>monic</em> polynomial if the leading coefficient is <m>1</m>.

        Let <m>R</m> be a ring and let <m>P=r_0+r_1X+\cdots+r_nX^n</m> be a polynomial in <m>R[X]</m>. The polynomial function <m>P(\cdot)\colon R\to R</m> is defined as follows:
        <me>
          P(x)=r_0+r_1x+\cdots+r_nx^n\quad\text{ for }x\in R.

    We state the following theorem without proof. The proof is similar to the proof of the division algorithm in field case.

  <theorem xml:id="thm-euclidean-division">
    <title>Euclidean Division</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a commutative ring with unity and <m>P_1,P_2\in A[X]</m> be polynomials. If the leading coefficient of <m>P_2</m> is invertible in <m>A</m>, then there exist unique polynomials <m>Q,R\in A[X]</m> such that <m>P_1=P_2Q+R</m> and <m>\deg R &lt; \deg P_2</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>I=\{f\in\Q[X,Y]:f(t^2,t^3)=0\text{ for }t\in\Q\}</m>. We show that <m>Y^2-X^3</m> divides <m>f\in I</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>A=\Q[X]</m>. Note that <m>\Q[X,Y]=A[Y]</m>. As <m>Y^2-X^3</m> is a monic polynomial in <m>A[Y]</m>, there exists <m>Q,R\in A[Y]</m> such that <m>f=Q(X,Y)(Y^2-X^3)+R(X,Y)</m> with <m>R=a(X)Y+b(X)</m>. Therefore, <m>a(t^2)t^3+b(t^2)=0</m> for all <m>t\in\Q</m>. As <m>\Q</m> is an infinite field, we get that <m>a(Z^2)Z^3+b(Z^2)=0\in\Q[Z]</m>. Hence, by separating the odd and the even degree terms, we get that <m>a=0=b</m>, i.e., <m>R=0</m>. Therefore, <m>(Y^2-X^3)</m> divides <m>f</m>.
