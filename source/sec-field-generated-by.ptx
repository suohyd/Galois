                Let <m>E/F</m> be a field extension, and let <m>a\in E</m>. Then, <me>

    <proof>
        <p>
            Consider the evaluation <m>F</m>-algebra homomorphism <m>{\mathrm ev}_a\colon F[x]\to E</m> given by <m>p(x)\mapsto p(a)</m>. The image of this homomorphism is a subring of <m>E</m> containing <m>a</m>. By the closure of addition and multiplication the image of <m>{\mathrm ev}_a</m> is contained in every subring of <m>E</m> containing <m>F</m> and <m>a</m>. Thus, the image of <m>{\mathrm ev}_a</m> is the ring generated by <m>a</m>, i.e., <m>F[a]</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A similar argument shows the statement about <m>F(a)</m>.
